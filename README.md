The VSCode extension "iKosak Sync Now" synchronizes records with ServiceNow instances. Sync is done via REST protocol. Start syncing NOW records to the hard drive just after installing the extension. No other programs are required.

Synced records are being saved as files in folder `./src`. You can edit them and upload back to instance via `CMD+k+j` __(or CTRL+k+j for Windows)__ shortcut.

# Usage

[Watch video guide (3 min)](https://youtu.be/Tvexo9GNAuA) how to get started or follow the description.

1. Create an empty folder to sync with a NOW instance. Open this folder in VSCode.
2. Search for the command "Login to instance" to launch the extension and start authentication.
3. Once entered login data, check the config located at `./snconfig/syncconfig.yaml` to define tables, queries, naming of the files to be synced. Default config includes most useful data for a developer.
4. Click on instance name in bottom left corner of VS Code to start pulling data.
5. Search for a file in `./src` folder. __For example, press `CMD+p` and search for "Caller Close" to find the Business rule "Caller Close" on incident table.__
6. Once edited a file, use **CMD+k+j** (or Ctrl+k+j) shortcut to upload the updated record to the instance.

# Known restrictions

* There could be some issues for Windows users, as i am developing and testing mainly on macOS.
* You cannot create and upload new records.
* If you have created a new record in ServiceNow, you should proceed with "Pull all files.." command once again.
