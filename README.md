The VSCode extension "iKosak Sync Now" synchronizes records with ServiceNow instances. Sync is done via REST protocol. Start syncing NOW records to the hard drive just after installing the extension. No other programs are required.

# Usage

[Watch video guide (3 min)](https://youtu.be/Tvexo9GNAuA) how to get started or follow the description.

1. Create an empty folder to sync with a NOW instance. Open this folder in VSCode.
2. Search for the command "Login to instance" to launch the extension and start authentication.
3. Once entered login data, check the config located at `./snconfig/syncconfig.yaml` to define tables, queries, naming of the files to be synced. Default config includes most useful data for a developer.
4. Click on instance name in bottom left corner of VS Code to start pulling data.
5. Search for a file in `./src` folder. __For example, press `CMD+p` and search for "Caller Close" to find the Business rule "Caller Close" on incident table.__
6. Once edited a file, use **CMD+k+j** (or Ctrl+k+j) shortcut to upload the updated record to the instance.

# FAQ

*I have created a new record in NOW. How do i get it to the editor?*

You should use the **Pull a table** command and select the table you want to re-sync.

*Why i cannot push the record to NOW?*

There could be several reasons:
- You have no internet
- The record you are trying to edit is secured by system
- VS code got stucked. Reload it.
- The extension has a bug. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/andrekosak/ikosak-sync-now/issues) in Github.
